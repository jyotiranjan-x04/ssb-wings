  {
    q: "What exactly is the SSB and why is it 5 days long?",

Over 5 days, three independent assessors — a Psychologist, a Group Testing Officer and an Interviewing Officer — evaluate you for 15 Officer Like Qualities through Screening (Day 1), Psychology tests (Day 2), GTO tasks (Days 3–4), Personal Interview and the final Conference (Day 5). Three opinions, one verdict.",
  },
  {
    q: "I've cleared the written exam. How early should I start SSB preparation?",
    a: "Ideally 30–45 days before your Board date. Personality projection isn't crammed — it's conditioned. Our 15-day offline immersion or 20-day online masterclass, followed by self-practice on the Smart Learning App, is the rhythm most of our recommended candidates followed.",
  },
  {
    q: "I'm a repeater with conference-outs. Can you actually help?",
    a: "Repeaters are our specialty. We begin with a forensic analysis of your previous attempts, identify the exact OLQs you failed to project, and rebuild your dossier, interview narrative and GTO approach around them. Khushvant (3 conference-outs) and Chandan (5 attempts) wear stars today.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you guarantee a recommendation?",
    a: "No — and be wary of anyone who does. The Board's assessment is independent and confidential. What we guarantee is honest, assessor-grade preparation, personal attention and mentorship till your recommendation, however many attempts that takes. Our alumni also get free monthly practice sessions for life.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are the batch options and hostel arrangements?",
    a: "Offline: two 15-day batches begin every month at our Noida Sector 62 campus, with optional AC hostel at ₹500/day (3–4 sharing) including three meals. Online: 20-day batches run live from 8–10 PM IST with recordings provided. Seats in both are limited to protect personal attention.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which entries do you prepare aspirants for?",
    a: "All of them — NDA, CDS, AFCAT, TES, TGC, 10+2 Navy B.Tech, SSC Tech (Men & Women), NCC Special Entry, Indian Coast Guard, and service entries like ACC, PC(SL) and SCO. The SSB process is common; we tailor the interview and PIQ strategy to your specific entry.",
